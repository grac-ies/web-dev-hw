<h2>Why WE chose the Large Munsterlander</h2>

<p>Upland hunting is my passion and here in Montana we are fortunate to have a variety of game bird species to pursue. Our family hunts Blue Grouse in the early Sept. and then move to Sharptails and Hungarian Partridge in Oct. then finally Pheasants.

 The LM searches with determination and desire all the while working for their handler or hunting party.  These dogs use a variety of tools to find and point birds. They especially excel at finding cripples after the shot and as any pheasant hunter knows this is an extermely useful skill set to have in a gun dog.

 Being natural retreivers and great swimmers these dogs are more than happy to bring back a limit of Mallards! Whether it's a Canada Goose field hunt or Montana river hunts these dogs love to retreive.

The LM suits all of our hunting needs very well and not only are they great hunters they are great in the home. Always eager to please these dogs just need to be steered in the right direction.

The Large Munsterlander Association of America is the official breed organization for Large Munsterlanders in the United States. LMAA ensures that the breed is maintained and continues to improve by using performance-based breeding standards which are overseen by the breeding officer. This is great for any hunter who wants to know they are getting dogs from proven stock.

We decided to become a LM kennel after our experience with our girl Layla. Through NAVHDA hunt tests and hunting the last 4yrs with Layla, we decided that we would like to help bring the same experience we've been fortunate enough to have, to future puppy owners.
