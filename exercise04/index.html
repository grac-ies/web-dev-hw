    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm trying to tell you something
Something that I already said <br>
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who is trying to sell you something
Something that you already have <br>
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of this song <br>
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing <br>
While the others talk
We were listening to lovers rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom <br>
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer <br>
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of this song <br>
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing <br>
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do <br>
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing</p>
