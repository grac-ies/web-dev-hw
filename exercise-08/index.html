    <p>Im doing a website for my familys kennel! we breed hunting dogs and we wanted to get layout idea for a website so this is perfect <br>
    I want it to very clean cut and well organized <br>
  I want the site title to be large with a nice font <br>
I want to add a boarder around the text boxes in the about section <br>
padding elements for the pictures and or text <br>
margins to space everything out nicely <br>
not quite sure where I want to add the display element yet but when making the website I will get a feel for it <br>
I will have lots of position elements for pictures and tites etc. <br>
and I will have a text box within the contact page (not pictured but will be there)</p>
