i decided to takw this class because im looking to find a carrer somewhere in the meda art realm and i feel like this class would give me sone great insight.
i hope to understand more how to properly set up a website and organize it in a way that will set me up for a sucsessful art-filled future.
i chose a logo i recently designed for my familys kennel. i used a picture of our own dog layla and some birds my family commonly hunts. im hoping to use this class to make a website for the kennel as well!
