    <h1>Perks of Being A Wallflower</h1>
<hr>
    <div class="text">
<p>“To Charlie.” <br>
And the whole group said, “To Charlie.” <br>
I didn’t know why they did that, but it was very special to me that they did. Especially Sam. <br>
Especially her.<br>
I would tell you more about the homecoming dance, but now that I’m thinking about it, me letting <br>
out the air of Dave’s tires was the best part. I did try to dance like Bill suggested, but I usually like <br>
songs you can’t dance to, so I didn’t do it too much. Sam did look very pretty in her dress, but I was <br>
trying not to notice because I’m trying not to think of her that way. <br>
I did notice that Brad and Patrick never talked once during the whole dance because Brad was off <br>
dancing with a cheerleader named Nancy, who is his girlfriend. And I did notice that my sister was <br>
dancing with the boy she wasn’t supposed to even though a different boy picked her up at the house.<br>
After the dance, we left in Sam’s pickup. Patrick was driving this time. As we were approaching the <br>
Fort Pitt Tunnel, Sam asked Patrick to pull to the side of the road. I didn’t know what was going on.<br>
Sam then climbed in the back of the pickup, wearing nothing but her dance dress. She told Patrick to <br>
drive, and he got this smile on his face. I guess they had done this before.<br>
Anyway, Patrick started driving really fast, and just before we got to the tunnel, Sam stood up, and <br>
the wind turned her dress into ocean waves. When we hit the tunnel, all the sound got scooped up into <br>
a vacuum, and it was replaced by a song on the tape player. A beautiful song called “Landslide.” When <br>
we got out of the tunnel, Sam screamed this really fun scream, and there it was. Downtown. Lights on <br>
buildings and everything that makes you wonder. Sam sat down and started laughing. Patrick started <br>
laughing. I started laughing. <br>
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite. <br>
Love always, <br>
Charlie </p>  </div> <br>
